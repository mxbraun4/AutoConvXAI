# Universal Command Architecture Proposal

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Your AutoGen-powered system has been falling into **micromanagement patterns**:

- `smart_action_dispatcher.py` has grown to 1000+ lines of regex patterns
- Each new query type requires specific pattern matching code
- Complex patterns like `r'how\s+accurate.*?age\s*[>]\s*(\d+).*?and.*?(\w+)\s*[=]\s*(\d+)'`
- Violates the generalizability principles of your original design

## 🏗️ Universal Architecture Solution

Instead of regex micromanagement, leverage your **AutoGen agents** to extract structured commands:

### Current Flow (Problematic)
```
User Query → Smart Action Dispatcher (regex hell) → Dynamic Code Generation → Execution
```

### Proposed Flow (Universal)
```
User Query → AutoGen Agents → Universal Command Structure → Universal Parser → Dynamic Code Generation → Execution
```

## 📋 Universal Command Structure

```json
{
  "filters": [
    {"feature": "age", "operator": "greater", "value": 50},
    {"feature": "pregnancies", "operator": "equal", "value": 2},
    {"feature": "bmi", "operator": "less", "value": 30}
  ],
  "function": "score",
  "params": {
    "metric": "accuracy",
    "instance_id": 5,
    "method": "lime",
    "scope": "topk",
    "topk_count": 3
  }
}
```

## 🔧 Implementation Components

### 1. Modified AutoGen Action Planning Agent

**Before**: Generated string commands like `"filter age greater 50 score accuracy"`

**After**: Generates structured JSON:
```json
{
  "command": {
    "filters": [{"feature": "age", "operator": "greater", "value": 50}],
    "function": "score", 
    "params": {"metric": "accuracy"}
  },
  "reasoning": "User wants accuracy for age > 50",
  "confidence": 0.9
}
```

### 2. Universal Command Parser

**Clean, simple parser** that handles the structured format:

```python
class UniversalCommandParser:
    def parse_command(self, command_structure: Dict) -> List[str]:
        # Build filter actions
        for filter_spec in command_structure['filters']:
            actions.append(f"filter {filter_spec['feature']} {filter_spec['operator']} {filter_spec['value']}")
        
        # Build function action  
        function_action = self._build_function_action(command_structure['function'], command_structure['params'])
        actions.append(function_action)
        
        return actions
```

### 3. Integration Points

- **AutoGen Decoder**: Modified to use universal parser for responses
- **Generalized Logic**: Seamlessly works with structured commands
- **Dynamic Code Generation**: Receives clean action lists

## 🎯 Example Transformations

### Multi-Filter Accuracy Query

**User**: "How accurate is the model on instances with age > 50 and pregnancies = 2?"

**AutoGen Output**:
```json
{
  "filters": [
    {"feature": "age", "operator": "greater", "value": 50},
    {"feature": "pregnancies", "operator": "equal", "value": 2}
  ],
  "function": "score",
  "params": {"metric": "accuracy"}
}
```

**Universal Parser Output**: 
```python
["filter age greater 50", "filter pregnancies equal 2", "score accuracy"]
```

### Complex What-If Analysis

**User**: "What if we increase glucose by 20 for patients over 40?"

**AutoGen Output**:
```json
{
  "filters": [
    {"feature": "age", "operator": "greater", "value": 40}
  ],
  "function": "change",
  "params": {
    "feature": "glucose",
    "operation": "increase", 
    "new_value": 20
  }
}
```

**Universal Parser Output**:
```python
["filter age greater 40", "change glucose increase 20"]
```

## ✅ Key Benefits

### 1. **Eliminates Micromanagement**
- No more regex patterns for specific query types
- No more `r'how\s+accurate.*?age\s*[>]\s*(\d+).*?and.*?(\w+)\s*[=]\s*(\d+)'`
- Universal structure works for ANY feature combination

### 2. **Maintains AutoGen Sophistication**
- Preserves your research-quality multi-agent system
- Keeps sophisticated Intent Extraction, Action Planning, and Validation agents
- No loss of natural language understanding capabilities

### 3. **True Generalizability**
- Works with unlimited feature combinations
- No hardcoded patterns or special cases
- Extensible to any dataset or domain

### 4. **Clean Architecture**
- Clear separation of concerns
- AutoGen handles understanding → Universal parser handles structure → Dynamic code generation handles execution
- Easy to maintain and extend

### 5. **Backward Compatibility**
- Universal parser outputs action strings for existing dynamic code generation
- No disruption to your current framework
- Smooth migration path

## 🧪 Validation Results
