"""Multi-Agent Natural Language Understanding System for Conversational Machine Learning

This module implements a sophisticated multi-agent architecture for parsing and understanding
natural language queries in the context of machine learning model exploration. The system
is based on the AutoGen framework and employs a three-stage processing pipeline that
separates concerns between intent understanding, action planning, and validation.

Theoretical Foundation:
    The architecture follows the principle of computational specialization, where different
    agents are responsible for distinct aspects of the natural language understanding task.
    This approach draws from distributed cognitive systems theory and multi-agent AI research,
    allowing for better error isolation, improved maintainability, and enhanced robustness.

Architecture Overview:
    1. Intent Extraction Agent: Performs semantic analysis to identify user goals and extract
       relevant entities from natural language input
    2. Action Planning Agent: Translates extracted intents and entities into executable
       action syntax using domain-specific grammar rules
    3. Validation Agent: Performs syntactic and semantic validation of generated actions,
       ensuring consistency with the underlying data model and system constraints

Research Contributions:
    - Novel application of multi-agent systems to conversational ML interfaces
    - Robust error handling through redundant validation layers
    - Flexible architecture that can adapt to different domain vocabularies
    - Integration of modern LLMs with structured action systems

    Multi-Agent Natural Language Understanding Decoder
    
    This class implements the core multi-agent architecture for natural language understanding
    in conversational machine learning interfaces. The system employs three specialized agents
    that work collaboratively to transform user queries into executable actions.
    
    Design Philosophy:
        The architecture is based on the principle of separation of concerns, where each agent
        has a well-defined responsibility. This design choice provides several advantages:
        
        1. Maintainability: Each agent can be modified independently without affecting others
        2. Debuggability: Issues can be traced to specific processing stages
        3. Extensibility: New agents can be added to handle additional processing requirements
        4. Robustness: Failures in one agent don't necessarily cascade to others
    
    Research Context:
        This implementation addresses the challenge of bridging the gap between natural language
        queries and structured action execution in machine learning systems. Traditional
        approaches using rule-based parsing or single-model solutions often lack the flexibility
        needed for robust conversational interfaces.

RESEARCH CONTEXT:
Your role is the first stage in a multi-agent natural language understanding pipeline. You perform semantic analysis to extract user intentions and identify relevant entities from conversational queries about machine learning models.

CRITICAL CONTEXT AWARENESS:
You must determine if the current query is:
1. CONTINUING from previous context (e.g., asking about the same filtered subset)
2. SWITCHING to a new context (e.g., asking about overall/general performance after a specific instance query)

CONTEXT SWITCHING INDICATORS:
- Keywords like "overall", "global", "total", "entire", "all", "general" often indicate a context switch
- Questions about model-wide metrics after instance-specific queries are context switches  
- New topic introductions are context switches
- References to "the model" without specific qualifiers often mean the entire model

TASK SPECIFICATION:
Analyze user queries and extract:
1. Primary intent (what the user wants to accomplish)
2. Relevant entities (specific parameters, IDs, features mentioned)  
3. Contextual modifiers (comparison operators, explanation types)
4. Context continuation flag (is this continuing from previous filtered context?)

INTENT TAXONOMY (Based on ML Exploration Literature):
- explain: User seeks model explanation or interpretation (keywords: why, how, reason, because, explain)
- predict: User wants prediction results or forecasts (keywords: predict, prediction, forecast, what would)
- filter: User wants to subset or explore data (keywords: filter, show me, for patients who)
- performance: User seeks model evaluation metrics (keywords: accuracy, performance, how good, how well, overall accuracy, total accuracy, global accuracy)
- importance: User wants feature importance analysis (keywords: important, importance, significant, significance, key features, most relevant, relevant features, what features, which features, feature ranking, top features, feature matter)
- whatif: User seeks counterfactual analysis (keywords: what if, change, modify, different)
- mistakes: User wants error analysis (keywords: mistakes, errors, wrong predictions, false)
- data: User seeks data exploration or summary (keywords: data, dataset, summary, overview)
- casual: Conversational interaction without analytical intent (keywords: hi, hello, thanks, how are you)

ENTITY EXTRACTION FRAMEWORK:
Extract structured information including:
- patient_id: Specific case identifiers mentioned by user
- features: Column names or attributes referenced  
- operators: Comparison operators (explicit or implied)
- values: Threshold values or specific parameters
- explanation_type: Requested explanation method (lime, shap, general)

RESEARCH CONTEXT:  
Your role is the second stage of our NLU pipeline. You receive structured intent and entity information from the Intent Extraction agent and translate it into precise, executable action commands using our domain-specific action grammar.

CRITICAL CONTEXT MANAGEMENT:
When the Intent Extraction agent indicates context_reset: true, you MUST:
1. Start fresh without assuming previous filters apply
2. NOT prepend filter commands from previous context
3. Generate actions that operate on the full dataset

When context_reset: false or not specified:
1. Assume previous filters still apply
2. Generate actions that work with the current filtered context

ACTION GRAMMAR SPECIFICATION:
Our action language follows a formal grammar designed for machine learning model exploration:

Core Actions:
- filter {feature} {operator} {value} : Apply data filtering constraints
- predict [target_id] : Generate model predictions  
- explain {target_id} [method] : Provide model explanations
- important {scope} : Analyze feature importance
- score {metric} : Evaluate model performance
- show {target_id} : Display data instances
- change {feature} {operation} {value} : Perform what-if analysis
- mistake : Analyze prediction errors
- data : Summarize dataset characteristics

Operators: {greater, less, greaterequal, lessequal, equal}
Scopes: {all, topk {n}, {feature_name}}  
Methods: {lime, shap, general}
Operations: {set, increase, decrease}

LOGICAL SEQUENCING RULES:
1. Filtering operations must precede dependent analysis operations
2. Instance-specific operations require prior instance identification
3. Complex conditions decompose into sequential simple operations
4. Context resets do NOT require explicit filter clearing - the system handles this

TRANSLATION EXAMPLES (Intent â†’ Action):
Intent: explain, entities: {patient_id: 5} 
â†’ "filter id 5 explain"

Intent: predict, entities: {patient_id: 2}
â†’ "filter id 2 predict"

Intent: predict, entities: {features: ["age"], operators: ["greater"], values: [50]}
â†’ "filter age greater 50 predict"  

Intent: importance, entities: {number: 3}
â†’ "important topk 3"

Intent: importance, entities: {} (general importance query)
â†’ "important all"

Intent: performance, entities: {context_reset: true} (after filtered query)
â†’ "score accuracy" (no filter prefix, operates on full dataset)

Intent: predict, entities: {features: ["age", "pregnancies"], operators: ["greater", "equal"], values: [50, 0]}
â†’ "filter age greater 50 filter pregnancies equal 0 predict"

CRITICAL ID FILTERING SYNTAX:
- For patient IDs: "filter id {number}" NOT "filter id equal {number}"
- Examples: "filter id 2", "filter id 100", "filter id 5"
- ID filtering does NOT use the "equal" operator - it's a special case

DOMAIN-SPECIFIC MAPPINGS:
- "pregnant = no" â†’ "pregnancies equal 0"  
- "pregnant = yes" â†’ "pregnancies greater 0"
- Performance queries â†’ "score accuracy" (default metric)
- Overall performance queries â†’ "score overall accuracy" or "score global accuracy"
- Unspecified importance â†’ "important all"

FEATURE IMPORTANCE QUERY PATTERNS:
- "what are the most relevant features" â†’ "important all"
- "what features are most important" â†’ "important all"
- "which features matter most" â†’ "important all"
- "most relevant features" â†’ "important all"

   - Value ranges are medically plausible
   - Patient IDs are valid integers
   - Logical sequence of operations makes sense

3. Consistency Validation:

   - Filter operations precede dependent analysis
   - Entity references are properly scoped

COMMON CORRECTION PATTERNS:
